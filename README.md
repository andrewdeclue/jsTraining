# jsTraining
This is a repository of what I've learned, primarily using teamtreehouse.com

Mostly this will be just the biggest project of each section, which capstones the section and incorporates all the learning done there.  The idea is not to show off the code so much as to show the progression.

Again, these are not my original works but things done through my training through teamtreehouse.com
